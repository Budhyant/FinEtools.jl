# Algorithms

Solution procedures and other  common operations on FEM models  are expressed  in algorithms. Anything that algorithms can do,  the user of FinEtools  can do manually, but to use an algorithm is convenient.

Algorithms  accept a single argument, `modeldata`, a dictionary of data, keyed by Strings. Algorithms  also return `modeldata`,  typically  including additional key/value pairs that represent the data computed by the algorithm.

##  Base algorithms

These are not specific to the particular physics at hand. Examples of  algorithms are  Richardson extrapolation,  calculation of the norm of the field, or calculation of the norm  of the difference of two fields.

## Acoustics algorithms

## Heat diffusion algorithms

## Linear deformation algorithms
