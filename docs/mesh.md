# Mesh

The mesh consists of finite element nodes  and  finite elements. 

A mesh  is generated by one of the functions specialized to a particular finite element type. Thus there are  mesh generation functions for lines, triangles, quadrilaterals, tetrahedra, and hexahedra.

One of the  organizing principles of the  finite element collection  is that some finite elements appear as elements in their own right but also as  parts of the boundary of another  finite element of higher dimension.  Thus  for instance  4-node  quadrilaterals  are finite elements that represent cross-sections of  axially symmetric models or surfaces  of membranes,  but they are also the boundaries of hexahedral  models.
