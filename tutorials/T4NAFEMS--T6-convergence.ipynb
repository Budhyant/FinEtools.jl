The meshes of the rectangles are then  repeatedly refined by quadri-section: each triangle is split into four triangles  of half the size.   The three node triangles are then converted  to  quadratic (six-node) triangles. The boundary of this mesh is then extracted and used  to construct the FEMM for the convection boundary condition. The model data is then passed to the steady-state solver. Finally, the temperature at point A is extracted and stored, and the  relative element size is also recorded."
